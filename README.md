Feedback from Nuradil Mataraimov : Interesting performance
It would seem that tic-tac-toe is a very simple game and easy, but when my friends and I did not know what to play in school, it is very suitable, children from all over the class joined our company. Whoever won got a cupcake with condensed milk).Interesting performance
